# Demo data — PHP Open Redirect Companion

For capturing the real Marketplace screenshot:

1. `./gradlew runIde`
2. Open `demo/login_handler.php` as a scratch/standalone file (or drop
   it into any sandbox project) inside the sandbox IDE.
3. The `header('Location: ' . $_GET['returnUrl'])` call inside
   `redirect_after_login` shows the warning — hover it for the
   tooltip. `redirect_after_login_safely`'s allowlist-validated local
   variable stays clean, for contrast.
4. Enter Full Screen (`View > Appearance > Enter Full Screen`), capture
   with `Win+Shift+S`, save directly to `docs/screenshots/` in this
   repo.
